# "How to find a planet?" tutorial

This repository contains the materials used by Geert Barentsen
to give a trial talk at the Athenaeum house in Atherton, California,
on Friday May 19th, 2017, titled "How to find a planet?".

The talk consisted of both a slide deck and a Jupyter notebook.
It aimed explain how one may go about finding a planet
in the original Kepler pixel data, using nothing more than a
handful lines of Python code.

The audience consisted of engineers with strong computing skills
but without (professional) astronomy experience.
This is an audience I would like to target in the future
for the sake of recruiting more talent into astronomy!
